# Otter CLI Tool - Purpose and Vision

## Overview

Otter is a development environment setup tool that simplifies the process of bootstrapping and configuring projects through a **layer-based approach**. It eliminates the repetitive task of manually setting up development environments by pulling reusable configuration templates from git repositories and intelligently applying them based on your specific context.

## The Problem Otter Solves

### Development Environment Setup Pain Points

Modern software development involves complex environment setup that often includes:

- **Multiple configuration files** (`.vscode/`, `.cursor/`, `.gitignore`, `Dockerfile`, etc.)
- **Framework-specific boilerplate** (package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt)
- **Environment-specific configurations** (development vs. production settings)
- **Platform-specific tools** (macOS vs. Linux vs. Windows specific scripts)
- **Team standards and conventions** (linting rules, code formatting, CI/CD pipelines)
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests)

### Traditional Approaches and Their Limitations

1. **Manual Setup**: Time-consuming, error-prone, inconsistent across team members
2. **Project Templates**: Monolithic, difficult to maintain, don't adapt to different environments
3. **Shell Scripts**: Platform-specific, hard to version, difficult to share and reuse
4. **Copy-Paste**: Leads to configuration drift, no central source of truth

## Otter's Solution: Layered Environment Composition

### Core Concept: Layers

Otter treats your development environment as a **composition of layers**, where each layer is a git repository containing:

- Configuration files
- Scripts and tools
- Documentation
- Best practices

These layers can be **conditionally applied** based on:

- **Environment** (development, staging, production)
- **Operating System** (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Editor/IDE** (VS Code, Cursor, Vim)
- **Technology Stack** (Go, React, Python)
- **Custom Variables** (team preferences, project type)

### Key Benefits

#### 1. **Modularity and Reusability**

```dockerfile
# Base project setup - used across all projects
LAYER git@github.com:company-layers/project-base.git

# Language-specific setup - only for Go projects
LAYER git@github.com:company-layers/go-setup.git IF language=go

# Environment-specific configurations
LAYER git@github.com:company-layers/dev-tools.git IF env=development
LAYER git@github.com:company-layers/prod-config.git IF env=production
```

#### 2. **Environment-Aware Intelligence**

Otter automatically detects and adapts to your environment:

- Applies macOS-specific configurations only on macOS
- Uses development tools only in development environment
- Configures the right editor settings based on detected IDE

#### 3. **Version Control and Collaboration**

- All layers are git repositories with full version control
- Teams can share and maintain common configurations
- Easy to update and distribute changes across projects

#### 4. **Consistency at Scale**

- Ensures all team members have identical development setups
- Reduces "it works on my machine" problems
- Enforces company standards and best practices

## Use Cases

### 1. **New Project Initialization**

```bash
# Initialize a new Go web API project
export OTTER_FRAMEWORK=go
export OTTER_TYPE=api
export OTTER_DATABASE=postgres
otter init && otter build
```

### 2. **Team Onboarding**

New team members get a fully configured environment in seconds:

```bash
git clone company-project
cd company-project
otter build
# Development environment ready!
```

### 3. **Multi-Environment Development**

```bash
# Development setup
otter build

# Switch to production configuration
export OTTER_ENV=production
otter build
```

### 4. **Cross-Platform Development**

The same Otterfile works across all platforms, automatically applying OS-specific configurations.

### 5. **Microservices Architecture**

Each service can inherit common layers while adding service-specific configurations:

```dockerfile
# Common microservice setup
LAYER git@github.com:company-layers/microservice-base.git
LAYER git@github.com:company-layers/monitoring.git

# Service-specific configurations
LAYER git@github.com:company-layers/user-service-config.git IF service=user
LAYER git@github.com:company-layers/payment-service-config.git IF service=payment
```

## Architecture and Design Philosophy

### Layer-First Design

Every configuration, script, or tool is organized as a **layer** that can be:

- Independently versioned
- Conditionally applied
- Composed with other layers
- Shared across projects

### Declarative Configuration

The Otterfile uses declarative syntax similar to Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# What you want, not how to get it
LAYER git@github.com:layers/react-setup.git IF framework=react
LAYER git@github.com:layers/typescript.git IF language=typescript
```

### Smart Defaults with Explicit Overrides

- Sensible defaults for common scenarios
- Environment auto-detection where possible
- Easy overrides through environment variables

### Git-Native

- Leverages existing git infrastructure
- Natural versioning and branching for layers
- Works with public and private repositories
- Integrates with existing CI/CD workflows

2. **Define standard Otterfiles** for different project types
3. **Share configurations** across projects and team members
4. **Iterate and improve** layers based on team feedback

### For Organizations

- Establish **layer governance** and naming conventions
- Create **organization-wide base layers** for security and compliance

## Conclusion

Otter transforms development environment setup from a manual, error-prone process into an **automated, consistent, and collaborative** experience. By treating environment configuration as **composable layers**, Otter enables teams to build robust, reusable, and intelligent development workflows that adapt to any context.

**The future of development environment setup is layered, conditional, and collaborative. Otter makes that future available today.**

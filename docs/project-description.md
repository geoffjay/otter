# Project Description of the Otter Tool

<purpose>
There are so many files that are used to configure different tools, and more
and more of them are coming from external repositories. Cursor rules, Claude
agents/hooks/commands etc. Otter is a tool that can be used to construct a
set of immutable files from external sources as layers. A single Otterfile
can be used to define which layers are applied and how, files can be ignored,
layers can be placed into a target, environment variables can be used to
conditionally apply or control the layer, and more.

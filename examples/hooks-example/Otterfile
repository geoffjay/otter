# Hooks & Lifecycle Events Example
# This demonstrates how to use hooks for documentation site generation and other automation

# Global hooks - executed for the entire build process
ON_BEFORE_BUILD: ["echo 'Starting Otter build process...'", "mkdir -p temp"]
ON_AFTER_BUILD: ["echo 'Build completed successfully!'", "rm -rf temp"]
ON_ERROR: ["echo 'Build failed - cleaning up...'", "rm -rf temp", "echo 'Cleanup completed'"]

# Documentation layer with hooks for static site generation
# This would be perfect for your use case!
LAYER ./docs-layer \
  TARGET docs \
  AFTER ["echo 'Documentation site ready!'"]

# Development tools layer with setup hooks
LAYER ./dev-tools BEFORE ["echo 'Setting up development environment...'"] AFTER ["chmod +x scripts/*.sh", "./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh"]

# Database layer with initialization hooks  
LAYER ./database-layer BEFORE ["echo 'Preparing database setup...'"] AFTER ["./scripts/init-db.sh", "echo 'Database initialized'"]
